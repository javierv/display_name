= display_name

Easily specify which method to use to display an object. It was created to work in Rails models, though it works with any Ruby class.

== Install

    gem install display_name

== Usage

    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
      display_name :full_name
    end

This will generate a method "display_name" for the record, which will return the full name. It will also override the "to_s" method, so in the view you could use:

    <%= person %>

That would automatically display the full name of the person. It also helps populating selects for lists of records.

Note that the display_name can be any method, and not necessary a database column.
